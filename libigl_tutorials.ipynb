    "Libigl is an open source C++ library for geometry processing research and development. The python bindings combine the rapid prototyping familiar to Matlab to Python programmers with the performance and versatility of C++. The tutorial is a self-contained, hands-on introduction to libigl in Python.  Via interactive, step-by-step examples, we demonstrate how to accomplish common geometry processing tasks such as computation of differential quantities and operators, real-time deformation, parametrization, numerical optimization and remeshing. Each section of the lecture notes contains a simple Python example application."

    "\n",
    "We introduce libigl with a series of self-contained examples. The purpose of\n",
    "each example is to showcase a feature of libigl while applying to a practical\n",
    "problem in geometry processing. In this chapter, we will present the basic\n",
    "concepts of libigl.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libigl design principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the examples, we summarize the two main design principles in\n",
    "libigl:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No complex data types.** We mostly use `numpy` or `scipy` matrices and vectors. This greatly\n",
    "  favors code reusability and interoperability and forces the function authors to expose all the\n",
    "  parameters used by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function encapsulation.** Every function is contained in a unique Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Libigl\n",
    "Libigl can be downloaded from [Conda forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/igl):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge igl \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of libigl functionality depends only on `numpy` and `scipy`. For the visualization in this tutorial we use [meshplot](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/meshplot) which can be easily installed from Conda:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge meshplot \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using libigl (with the plots) you just need to import it together with the `numpy`, `scipy`, and `meshplot`."

    "triangles. Libigl has three different methods for subdividing a triangle mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"in plane\" subdivision method will not change the point set or carrier\n",

    "and vertices surviving from the original mesh are not moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding new faces, a subdivision algorithm changes the _combinatorics_ of the\n",
    "mesh. The change in combinatorics and the formula for positioning the\n",
    "high-resolution vertices is called the \"subdivision rule\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the _in plane_ subdivision method of `igl.upsample`, vertices\n",
    "are added at the midpoint of every edge: $v_{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}(v_a + v_b)$ and\n",

    "smoothed as it is refined <cite data-cite=\"loop_1987\">(Loop, 1987)</cite>. This and other _smooth subdivision_\n",
    "methods can be understood as generalizations of spline curves to surfaces. In\n",

    "consider the limit of recursive applications of subdivision. Away from\n",
    "\"irregular\" or \"extraordinary\" vertices (vertices of the original cage with\n",
    "valence not equal to 6), the surface is $C^2$. The combinatorics (connectivity\n",
    "and number of faces) of `igl.loop` and `igl.upsample` are identical: the only\n",
    "difference is that the vertices have been smoothed in `igl.loop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, libigl also implements a form of _in plane_ \"false barycentric\n",

    "triangle with three triangles $(i_a,i_b,i_{abc})$, $(i_b,i_c,i_{abc})$, and\n",
    "$(i_c,i_a,i_{abc})$. In contrast to `igl.upsample`, this method will create\n",
